PyDep is a Python script designed to analyze and visualize the dependencies within a Python project. It recursively scans the specified directory for Python files, extracts import statements and file interactions (CSV and JSON), and generates an interactive dependency graph using NetworkX and Plotly.

Features
Recursive Python File Search: Finds all Python files in a specified directory, with options to ignore certain subdirectories.
Dependency Extraction: Extracts import statements, CSV file interactions, and JSON file interactions from each Python file.
Interactive Visualization: Creates an interactive dependency graph using Plotly, displaying the relationships between modules, CSV files, and JSON files.
Customizable Layout: Applies a custom layout to the graph for better visualization of dependencies.
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required packages:


pip install networkx plotly numpy
Clone the repository or download the script directly:


git clone https://github.com/infinition/pydep.git
cd pydep
Usage
To run the script, follow these steps:

Navigate to the script directory:


cd path/to/pydep
Run the script:


python pydep.py
Provide the required input:
The script will prompt you to enter the path of the directory you wish to analyze and optionally any directories you want to ignore.

Example:


Enter the path to the Python project directory: /path/to/project
Do you want to ignore any directories? (Y/N): Y
Enter the directories to ignore, separated by commas: dir_to_ignore1, dir_to_ignore2
Output:
The script will generate and display an interactive dependency graph in your default web browser.

Example

# Run the script
python pydep.py

# Sample input prompts
Enter the path to the Python project directory: /home/user/projects
Do you want to ignore any directories? (Y/N): Y
Enter the directories to ignore, separated by commas: tests, docs

# Output
Dependency graph generated and displayed.
Script Details
find_python_files(directory, ignore_dirs=None)
This function recursively finds all Python files in a directory, excluding specified ignored directories.

Parameters:
directory (str): The root directory to explore.
ignore_dirs (list): List of directories to ignore.
Returns: A list of paths to Python files.
extract_imports(file_path)
This function extracts all import statements and file interactions (CSV and JSON) from a Python file.

Parameters: file_path (str): The path to the Python file.
Returns: A tuple containing lists of imports, CSV files, and JSON files.
build_dependency_graph(directory, ignore_dirs)
This function builds a dependency graph from Python files in a directory.

Parameters:
directory (str): The root directory to explore.
ignore_dirs (list): List of directories to ignore.
Returns: A dictionary representing the dependencies.
generate_graph(dependencies)
This function generates a NetworkX graph from dependencies.

Parameters: dependencies (dict): A dictionary of dependencies.
Returns: A NetworkX graph object.
custom_layout(graph, iterations=500, k=0.5)
This function applies a custom layout to the graph for better visualization.

Parameters:
graph (NetworkX graph): The graph to layout.
iterations (int): Number of iterations for the spring layout algorithm.
k (float): Optimal distance between nodes.
Returns: A dictionary of positions.
draw_graph(graph)
This function draws the graph using Plotly for interactive visualization.

Parameters: graph (NetworkX graph): The graph to draw.
Returns: None.
main()
The main function that orchestrates the workflow.

Parameters: None.
Returns: None.
